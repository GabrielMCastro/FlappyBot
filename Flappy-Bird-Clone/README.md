# Flappy Bird Clone

The original game is created by Daniel Shiffman. http://codingtra.in

This version is modified to be played by an Artificial Neural Network.

# How it works
This Flappy Bird clone is played by an ANN which uses a genetic algorithm to train. The algorithm trains by selecting the highest performing network out of a population and making those traits more likely to occur in future "generations," slowly increasing the average fitness of the AI over time.
